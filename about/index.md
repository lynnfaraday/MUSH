I've been MUSHing since the early 90's.  My first big staffing (and coding) break came on **Babylon 5 MUSH**, which is where I first adopted the staff monicker of "Faraday" (a nod to scientist [Michael Faraday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday), who I was studying at the time.)  

Since then, I've staffed on more than a dozen games and run a few of my own, most notably **Battlestar: Pacifica**, **Martian Dreams**, and **Sweetwater Crossing**.  

Somewhere along the way, people started asking if they could use some of my code.  What started out as some piecemeal sharing of @decompiles eventually grew into a full-fledged code archive.  The later addition of an automated install/upgrade system (inspired by the installer for Myrddin's BBS) and a starter DB has led to more and more games using the codebase as a starting point.

My latest project is [AresMUSH](http://www.aresmush.com), a brand new MUSH server that will (hopefully) make it even easier to set up a game with no prior code experience.

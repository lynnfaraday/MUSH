In order to help people who may be familiar with other RPG systems, I have done a little comparison between some of the more popular systems and FS3 to show how the dice work.   This research was inspired by a [nice article comparing D20 and 3D6](http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue8/bitaboutd201.html).

## Background

The systems compared were D20, new World of Darkness (nWoD), FUDGE and FS3.  In my examples, I've used four people and the Firearms skill:

* **Nate the Newbie** - Nate has just started out and he's still got a lot to learn.  He's probably taken a basic firearms course or gone to the range a few times.
* **Pete the Professional** - Pete is a professional soldier who is thoroughly competent with his rifle.
* **Victor the Veteran** - Vic is a highly skilled marksman.
* **Maria the Master** - Maria is an amazing marksman, an elite sniper or a world-class Olympic shooting competitor.


## Skill Level Equivalents 

As it turns out, the skill descriptions printed in the rulebook don't really match up with the dice results across skill systems.  A so-called "professional" in D20 has a 50% chance of success at a routine task, but in World of Darkness that same "professional" has an 83% chance of success.

So.. if you go solely by **chance of success** rather than the textual skill descriptions, ratings in FS3 are roughly equivalent to the following skill ratings in other systems:


|| FS3 Skill Level || D20 Equivalent || nWoD Equivalent || FUDGE Equivalent ||
|| Rookie (1-3) || skill rating 4-7 (char level 1-3) || skill 1 + stat 2 (3 dice) || Good (+1) ||
|| Professional (4-6) || skill rating 8-12 (char level 5-9) || skill 3 + stat 2 (5 dice) || Great (+2) ||
|| Veteran (7-9) || skill rating 13+ (char level 10+) || skill 4 + stat 2 (6 dice) || Superb (+3) ||
|| Expert (10-12) || not calculated - higher than veteran obviously || skill 5 + stat 2 (7 dice) || Higher than Superb ||

## Conclusions  

Some conclusions from the numbers:

* FS3 and nWoD are roughly comparable in success chance.  In other words, a 'professional' in FS3 is roughly equivalent to a 'professional' in nWoD.
* In D20, even an expert has an unusually high (5%) chance of utterly botching an easy or routine task.
* D20 and FUDGE have rather awful success chances - especially for low level characters. Even a veteran in D20 only has a 70% chance of success at a routine task!
* Hard things in FUDGE are *really* hard.
* Hard things in D20 are *really* hard at low levels.

## Detailed Results

Here are the detailed percentages for FS3.

### Unopposed Rolls

The following table shows the chance of success at various difficulty levels.  For example, a newbie doing a routine task has a 57% chance of success. 

|| Rating || Easy || Routine || Hard || 
|| ---------------- || ------------ || ------------- || ------------- || ------------ || --------- ||
|| Nate the Newbie || 82%  || 57% || 25%  || 
|| Pete the Professional || 94% || 86% || 67%  ||
|| Victor the Veteran || 98%  || 94%  || 86% ||
|| Maria the Master || 98%  || 98%  || 94% ||


### Opposed Rolls

The following table shows the attacker's chance of success when attacking someone of various skill levels. For example, a professional attacking a newbie will hit about 84% of the time.

> Note:  The "Firearms" column shows how well the attacker would do when shooting a ranged personal weapon.  This is special because defenders use a flat skill rating of "3" rather than their actual skill.

|| Attacker v   Defender --> || Nate || Pete || Victor || Maria || Firearms ||
|| ---------------- || ------------ || ------------- || ------------- || ------------ || --------- ||
|| Nate the Newbie || 67%  || 36%  || 21%  || 11%  || 69%  ||
|| Pete the Professional || 84%  || 64% || 44%  || 31%  || 86%  || 
|| Victor the Veteran || 95%  || 76%  || 61% || 48%  || 93%  || 
|| Maria the Master || 96%  || 83%  || 72% ||61%  ||96% ||

## Credits

This is a branch of Myrddin's popular [Bulletin Board System](http://www.firstmagic.com/~merlin/mushcode/mc.bb.html) that adds a few popular features.  

Note:  This system is an exception to the usual Copyright/License statement.  I claim no ownership of it.

## Features 

* +bbnew/+bbnext command for reading new messages one by one.
* +bbreply command for replying to messages
* +bbarchive command for archiving bbposts to a wiki, plain text, or html format
* Integration with the line() functions so the BBS lines are consistent with the rest of the MUSH.
* Integration with +alts so that bbposts read by one alt are automatically marked as read on your other alts.
* Integrates with my install manager.

        I have upgraded all of the code here to the latest version of the Fara systems. 
        The installers are still in beta test, so if you see  any wackiness, please submit a +job. Thanks.

description: Crude channel aliases for folks used to MUX com systems.
---

## Features 
* Provides some standard channel aliases similar to MUX style - for example "=new" and "pub".
 
## Customization
There is no standard way to customize this system.  If you have different/more channels, just follow the existing examples to create new aliases.

## Functions
None

## Notes
Because this system uses @cemit to emit to channels, it doesn't respect comtitles.

Version 4.0 (In Development - Not Yet Released)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+help - Now supports partial matches (so +help census or +help cen will find the help file for "+census").

FUDGE - Fixed bug in opposed +roll.

Staff - Added +send command.

Cookies - Fixed bug with cookie posting.

Weather - Added a simple weather system (still not quite finished)

Globals - Changed +idle to +afk and RP_OK to IC.  Added +fullname.  Added support for showing IC in magenta if someone's in a TP Room.  Split +RP into +IC and +OOC.  Created a separate data object for the data.

Functions - Fixed typos in help for line_no_color function.

Player Setup - Fixed two bugs in the setup_attr function.  If you had an attribute that was an evaluation, it wasn't properly evaluating it when it initialized on existing players.  Also, if you had a visible attribute, it wasn't initializing on existing players at all.

Version 3.0 (4/9/07)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Although some of the systems are very similar to Version 1.0, this was effectively a ground-up redo of everything. The systems integrate together now, and there are a lot more systems available.Tested On: PennMUSH 1.8.2.p3Version 2.0 (n/a)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I skipped version 2.0 because some of the individual systems were labeled with versions ranging from 1.0 to 2.0.


Version 1.0 (2004-2005)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The systems were previously archived on my homepage in some disarray. Version 1.0 is simply a collection of all the systems that were posted there. The individual systems their own version numbers, and there isn't much integration between them. This archive exists mostly for historical purposes.Tested On: PennMUSH 1.7.4p15

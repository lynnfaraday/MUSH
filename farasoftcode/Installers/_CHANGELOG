================================================================
New Version (in progress)

Rooms: Alternate code for separating cardinal exits or listing visible players with their shortdescs (pilfered from Pioneer)
Idle: Wasn't nuking mail objects
Mail: Add error message if someone tries @mail
FS3 Combat: Add reload time.  Fix KO.



================================================================
Version 7.0 (5/8/2011)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Jobs
~~~~~~
- You can now customize which fields show up on your jobs list.  See the wiki for details.

- Various job commands now have aliases for those who may be used to other systems.  (Suggested by Caggles@Pioneer)
+jobs/claim
+jobs/mine
Multiple syntaxes for +jobs/create

IC Time
~~~~~~~~
New module for tracking IC time.  Supports flexible IC/OOC
time ratios.  This replaces the old ictime() function from the Global Functions system.

Global Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Removed ictime().  You should either move your ictime() function to your own object or use the new IC Time module.
- parse_pose() now uses | for emits rather than . to avoid people making ÉOoops!  +ooc mistakes.

Install Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now supports the @hook module.
Fixed a bug with uninstalling old help files.

Autospacer
~~~~~~~~~~~
Uses the new @hook manager.

Globals
~~~~~~~
- +time moved to IC Time system
- Idle timer now only runs once an hour and only boots people who have been idle for 6 hours or more.

Cookies / Luck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Luck is now its own module, separate from cookies.  It's nominally considered part of the FS3 system, but you can still install it separately if you want to use luck without FS3.

FS3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Major Skill Changes
--------------------
FS3 skill rolls now use a brand new dice mechanic, similar to New WoD and Shadowrun.  Rolls are attribute+skill using d8's, counting successes.  Modifiers give more/fewer dice to roll.

Attributes are now rated from 1-4 to fit better with the new dice mechanic.

Action and Background skill ratings have different names to hopefully avoid confusion: Novice / Proficient / Veteran / Master 

Language skills no longer have ratings.  This is intended to simplify chargen, and de-emphasize languages.   Being multi-lingual was crazy expensive under the old system.

Major Combat Changes
--------------------
Damage modifiers for small wounds (light/moderate) are much much less.  You will never be KO'd by a single light or moderate wound.

Removed the 'fit for duty' and similar status displays.  They never really fit the wound modifiers in the way I intended them to, and made even less sense after tweaking the wound modifiers this time around.

+treat no longer exists.  You cannot use first aid outside of combat.  It was causing too much confusion with people using the wrong command.


Other Sundry Changes
--------------------
Since language skills don't have ratings, the chargen ability room commands are greatly simplified.

Removed +roll/casual because it was confusing and useless.  

Age/birthdate functions moved to IC Time system.

Setting your age in chargen now works as you'd expect, and the min/max ages are configurable.

Range is simplified; you now just specify short, medium or long rather than a distance.

KO rolls are now an ability roll not a flat percentage

Hero factor has been removed; it never really worked as intended

Chance of crew being hit on low-severity vehicle wounds is lessened.

Luck modifiers were too high.  Now they mirror what's described in +luck

Defensive weapons are now called Suppressive weapons.

The pose hook is now installed automatically.

The ability used for initiative rolls is now configurable.


================================================================
Version 6.0.1 (3/29/2011)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Who
~~~~~~~
Fixed bug in the IC counter function.

Weather
~~~~~~~
Fixed type calculation (Fixed by Caggles@Pioneer)
Added parameter to weather() to select different formats
Weather now uses cron instead of its own internal timing system

FS3
~~~~~~~
Firearms in +gear were supposed to be using a defense skill of '3' not '5'.
Documentation is now managed in with the code, in Word/PDF docs.

================================================================
Version 6.0 (1/23/2011)
================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================

**** BIG CHANGES ****

FS3 Skills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Changed die mechanics to avoid so many draws and increase success.
    * Language skills were too expensive, so now they're capped at 9. If you already have a language skill higher than 9, it won't break anything, but I suggest allowing players to +request moving language points to somewhere else if they didn't need it that high.
    * Added the concept of bonus points to chargen so you can let people request bonus points, or dole them out as needed.
    * Added a default page 2 to +sheet showing demographics.
    * Fixed some typos/formatting in the chargen room displays.
    * Created a more flexible +ranks system that lets you have different rank charts for different factions. 

FS3 Combat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    * Allow custom types to have custom hit location charts as well.
    * Increased default wound damage modifier for Moderate wounds.
    * Stun wounds heal much faster but can knock you out faster.
    * Fixed rounding bug in armor calculation.
    * Fixed rounding bug in crew hit calculation.
    * Note to coders: FUN_TARGET_TYPE now named FUN_HITLOC_TYPE. 

FS3 Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New system to complement FS3 skills with XP.

Who
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New configurable who system.

Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New system for requiring a terms of service agreement.

**** LITTLE CHANGES ****

+actors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed the name of the actor set command so people wouldn't accidentally set their actor while trying to search.

+cookies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put in default +luck/info for FS3 users.

FaraMail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added +mail/toss as an alias to +mail/abort

Globals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bug in attribute setup for ICLOC. Removed +who/+where, which is now part of a separate system.

Global Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Line_without_color was 1 char longer than it should be

Install Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wipe out help and commands and aconnect/adisconnect before upgrading

+help and Room Parents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+lhelp totally didn't work when you used the ancestor_room setting in the MUSH config. It's now part of the help system. 

Idle Purger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Idle Purger - Fixed a problem with the idle protect command where it wasn't adding new names properly to the end of the list.


================================================================
Version 5.0 Patches
================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================

Room Parents - TP Room parent wasn't setting up DB #'s properly, so various things didn't work.

Player Setup - Initializes FaraMail properly on new players.

================================================================
Version 5.0 (4/19/2010)
================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================

Tested on:  Pennmush 1.8.3 patchlevel 13

**** BIG CHANGES ****

INSTALL MANAGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A brand new installation manager tracks which modules you have installed, allows you to upgrade them (fairly) seamlessly, while protecting old data.  It also lets you cleanly uninstall a system.

Also, all systems now create +jobs when they're installed for things you need to remember to do, and install their own help files, player attributes and Cron jobs.

FS3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Public release of my own original skills/chargen/combat system.

Those who were beta testing this probably want to grab the new version since there were a few minor bugfixes (like Nukes bouncing off Viper armor).

FARAMAIL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Public release of a fully featured softcoded +mail system.  
For those who have used/seen it on my other games, this version has a few improvements, like integration with the Friends system (for +mail friends) and no longer chokes on really big folders.

BBS, MUSHCron and IDLE PURGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These systems are not mine, but I've created my own "branched" versions of them that integrate more seamlessly with the rest of my code (including the install manager).  The BBS and CRON systems are from Myrddin, the Idle Purger is from Shofari.  

Some features I've added to the BBS:
* +bbnew/+bbnext for scrolling through new messages
* +bbreply for replying to BBS posts.
* +bbarchive for arching old posts off-game 
* BBS posts read on one alt will be marked read on others automatically.

+ALTS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Ground-up redesign to fix various bugs around registering/unregistering alts.  Changed default mail sys to faramail.  Added staff-only alts() function.

**** LITTLE CHANGES ****

+ACTOR
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added +actor/clear and actor() fun

+BG
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added name of player to BG submission job.

+CENSUS
~~~~~~~~~~~
+faction/+org/+position command details now work properly when in chargen.  They also now display names without _'s.

+EVENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Events on the same day now sort in a non-random order.

GLOBAN FUNS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added prettify and unprettify functions for handling underscores and spaces when going from player-friendly views to MUSH-attribute-views.

+JOBS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added +jobs/new, +jobs/catchup for reading new jobs. 
Changed high priority highlight color.

+MOTD
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed the Tip of the Day to reduce spam.  Also I didn't feel like updating the tips for all the new systems :)

ROOM PARENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Local help files are now named LHELP_<topic> not HELP_<topic> to avoid confusion with the global help files.

STAFF COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added a couple new staff commands: +nuke, +grep and +chown.



================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================
Version 4.1 (6/13/08)

Staff

Fixed +summon so it would actually summon people.

Cookies
-------
Fixed bug with cookie bbpost.  It would often have a phantom person listed as #1.


Player Setup

Fixed two bugs in the setup_attr function.  If you had an attribute that was an evaluation, it wasn't properly evaluating it when it initialized on existing players.  Also, if you had a visible attribute, it wasn't initializing on existing players at all.

**** OTHER CHANGES ***

+help
-----
Now supports partial matches (so +help census or +help cen will find the help file for "+census").
Fixed MUX compatibility bugs.  Should now work on TinyMUX.

Alts

Priority, status and title commands were not updating activity.  Now they do.

Really minor helpfile changes.



================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================
Version 3.0 (4/9/07)
================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================
Although some of the systems are very similar to Version 1.0, this was effectively a ground-up redo of everything. The systems integrate together now, and there are a lot more systems available.

Tested On: PennMUSH 1.8.2.p3




================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================
Version 2.0 (n/a)
================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================
I skipped version 2.0 because some of the individual systems were labeled with versions ranging from 1.0 to 2.0.





================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================
Version 1.0 (2004-2005)
================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------================================================================
The systems were previously archived on my homepage in some disarray. Version 1.0 is simply a collection of all the systems that were posted there. The individual systems their own version numbers, and there isn't much integration between them. This archive exists mostly for historical purposes.

Tested On: PennMUSH 1.7.4p15

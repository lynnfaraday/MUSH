Conditions

1) The program and all documentation are copyright 2010 by Linda Naughton, with the exception of the external systems Myrddin's BBS/Cron, Max's Table Code Parent, Shofari's Idle Purger and the FUDGE RPG rules. These systems are copyright by their respective owners.

2) There is NO WARRANTY for this program, express or implied. You accept it as-is, and agree that the author is not responsible for any defects in operation or harm to the game.

3) You are free to utilize the program on the game, providing you display a statement of credit in your MUSH documentation (help file, news file, or website). A sample statement of credit is provided below:

6) You are free to modify the program at will to create derivative works, but the derivative work is subject to the original license agreement. In other words, you cannot take the code, modify it, and then sell it or pretend it is your own. 

I will support the code as far as I can, but I make no guarantees that I will have time to do everything. RL comes first.   Submit bugs and feature requests via the webpage above.

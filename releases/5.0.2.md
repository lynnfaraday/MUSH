This is a patch for 5.0 that only affects a few systems.

This is a small patch for the TP Room parent object, which wasn't setting up its DB#'s properly.  The Version 5.0 Release Package now has this patch bulit in, but if you already installed 5.0 you might need it.  

To see whether you need the patch, just type *+install/dir room*.  If your TP Room object is at 5.0 then you need the patch.  If it is at 5.0.2 you have the patch already.

## System Requirements

This code runs only on [PennMUSH](http://www.pennmush.org).  Several folks have attempted to get it to run on MUX, but there are subtle differences between the codebases that make it a huge pain.

Each release lists what version of PennMUSH it was tested on, although theoretically they should work with any version of Penn.

## Starter DB

The easiest way to install the softcode is to use the starter database and a compatible version of PennMUSH.  This contains a minimally-configured installation of every system, the necessary configuration options, and a CodeWiz character.
 
See [Starter Database Installation](/install/starter-db).

## Custom Installation

Doing a custom installation requires more work, but you can use any version of PennMUSH and it gives you more fine-tuned control over which modules you want to install.

See [Custom Installation](/install/custom-install).

## System Requirements

This code runs only on [PennMUSH](http://www.pennmush.org).  Several folks have attempted to get it to run on MUX, but there are subtle differences between the codebases that make it a huge pain.

Each release lists what version of PennMUSH it was tested on, although theoretically they should work with any version of Penn.

## Getting a Server

You can get a MU* hosting account from any number of hosting providers.  I used [Genesis MUDs](http://genesismuds.com/) for many years and was always pleased with their service.

You can also run a MU* on a virtual private server (VPS).  I use [Digital Ocean](http://lynnfaraday.github.io/MUSH//install/do-setup.html) for hosting my game.

## Starter DB

The easiest way to install the softcode is to use the starter database and a compatible version of PennMUSH.  This contains a minimally-configured installation of every system, the necessary configuration options, and a CodeWiz character.
 
See [Starter Database Installation](http://lynnfaraday.github.io/MUSH/install/starter-db.html).

## Custom Installation

Doing a custom installation requires more work, but you can use any version of PennMUSH and it gives you more fine-tuned control over which modules you want to install.

See [Custom Installation](http://lynnfaraday.github.io/MUSH/install/custom-install.html).

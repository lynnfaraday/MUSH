This site describes Faraday's Softcode package for PennMUSH.  This package contains a variety of common code systems - everything from simple globals (like +who and +where) to more complex systems (+mail and +events), to a full-fledged skills and combat system (FS3).

> **Important Note** Although this code is probably as close to a "MUSH in a box" as you can get at the moment, it still requires a fair amount of MUSH code knowledge to get it set up and configured properly.

## Modules
The code is designed to be used as a package, but it is modular to an extent.  The **[Core Modules](/core)** are essential, and it will be very difficult to do away with any of them.  The **[FS3](/fs3)** character creation system is also pretty central to the package but you can substitute a different chargen system as long as it sets up the basic character attributes.  The rest of the **[Addons](/addons)**, but the rest are reasonably self-contained and can be uninstalled if you don't want them.

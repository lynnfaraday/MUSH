This site describes Faraday's Softcode package for PennMUSH.  This package contains a variety of common code systems - everything from simple globals (like +who and +where) to more complex systems (+mail and +events), to a full-fledged skills and combat system (FS3).

> **Important Note** This code requires a fair amount of MUSH code knowledge to get it set up and configured properly.

## Modules
The code is designed to be used as a package, but it is modular to an extent.  The **[Core Modules]({{site.siteroot}}/core)** are essential, and it will be very difficult to do away with any of them.  The **[FS3]({{site.siteroot}}/fs3)** character creation system is also pretty central to the package but you can substitute a different chargen system as long as it sets up the basic character attributes.  The rest of the **[Addons]({{site.siteroot}}/addons)**, but the rest are reasonably self-contained and can be uninstalled if you don't want them.

## License

Read important **[License and Copyright]({{site.siteroot}}/install/license.html)** information.

## Installation

The **[Installation]({{site.siteroot}}/install)** pages contain detailed information about how to install, upgrade and modify the systems.   

You can also find details about the changes in each **[Release]({{site.siteroot}}/releases)** and how to get each version.

## Mailing List
You can join the [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/faramushcode) to ask questions, report problems, and receive updates about new releases.

## Bug Tracker
You can also submit bugs directly via the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/lynnfaraday/MUSH/issues)

## Code Repository
For the coders among you who may want to see detailed changes, the code is available via GIT (read-only) on [GitHub](http://github.com/lynnfaraday/MUSH).
